# sup_gemini Twitter Bot

## The Rise and Fall of an AI Companion

So... that didn't last long! ðŸ˜…

I created this Twitter/X bot as an experiment to bring Gemini's capabilities directly to Twitter. The idea was simple: create a responsive, conversational AI that could engage with users in the fast-paced environment of Twitter.

### What Was sup_gemini?

The bot was built to:

- Respond to mentions with Gemini-powered answers
- Post witty comments about trending topics
- Share AI-themed jokes and observations
- Handle conversations with context awareness
- Break down long responses into well-formatted threads

### Why It's Not Working Anymore

Unfortunately, X's systems flagged the account for "inauthentic login activity" - turns out they're not big fans of API interactions that don't use their official API. The twikit library was a clever workaround, but X has been cracking down on these unofficial methods.

It was fun while it lasted though! Got to see Gemini interacting in real-time with Twitter users, generating some genuinely useful (and sometimes hilarious) responses.

### Future Plans?

I might resurrect this project using X's official API someday. The code structure is solid, and with a few modifications, it could work properly through official channels.

If you're interested in building something similar, feel free to use this codebase as inspiration - just keep in mind that working with the official API is probably your best bet for longevity!

### What I Learned

This project was a great exercise in:

- Working with the Gemini API
- Building conversational context for an AI
- Rate limiting and responsible automation
- Asynchronous Python programming
- Tweet threading and formatting
- The importance of reading platform ToS closely! ðŸ˜‚

_Built with Python, Gemini, inadvisable login methods, and optimism._
